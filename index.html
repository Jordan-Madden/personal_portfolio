                    Currently, I am an ICT Engineering Intern on the Microwave Engineering team at Huawei Technologies. Here, we work on deployment, monitoring, 
                    maintenance and upgrades of the Microwave Cell Network in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean.

                    I have recently completed my bachelors degree in Electronics Engineering where I specialized in Instrumentation and Automation. 
                    I am very passionate about robotics, artificial intelligence and IoT. I love learning and I desire to develop systems that can bridge the gap between 
                    the capabilities of hardware and software. I am particularly interested in the application of these systems to areas such as automation, healthcare 
                    and the assistance of the disabled.

                  I work towards the deployment, monitoring, maintenance and upgrades of the Microwave Cell Network in Jamaica and the

                  testing to determine the stability of various links, troubleshooting issues with links or the microwave equipment
                  and drafting moe technical documentation needed by the customers.

                    I was a teaching assistant for the Programming for Engineers I that is taught in C in semester 1 and
                    Programming for Engineers II that is taught in Java in semester 2. In this role I supported the lecturer by

                    student assignments.

                    Here, I worked in a team to develop an IoT enabled temperature monitoring system. I wrote C++ code to enable automatic 
                    temperature checking (and recording) as well as an alarm if the temperature is too high. Administrative capabilities were
                    also included where the temperature data would be sent to a server and would be accessible through a webpage.

                    I was a member of the IEEE Robotics Team at the UWI, Mona. Here we built
                    robots to compete at the IEEE Southeast Conference and for demonstration at national

                    robots, to help conceptualize and implement the circuits necessary for the robot to accomplish its given tasks
                    and to monitor code written by my teammate to ensure that it satisfies 
                    team standards.

                Teams were asked to use Artificial intelligence to develop a solution to a social issue. As such, my team used deep learning to 
                identify the location of guns in images. This was meant to be the first steps in the development of an automated system that can 
                notify the relevant authorities when guns are detected in image/video streams such as CCTV footage.
